# RRphylo

The goal of RRphylo is to compute phenotypic evolutionary rates,
estimate ancestral states, locate rate shifts on the tree, and compare
vectors of phenotypes and evolutionary rates among species. RRphylo is
not based on any evolutionary model, and is best suited to work with
phylogenies of fossil species.
